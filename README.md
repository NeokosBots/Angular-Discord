# Angular-Discord
Make (almost) everything that has a rounded edge on Discord rectangular.

***PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO REMOVE YOUR THEME FROM MINE. I TAKE NO CREDIT FROM ELEMENTS FROM THEIR THEME, SUCH AS:***
* Status around avatar instead of a dot to show status
* https://discordstyles.github.io/RadialStatus/dist/RadialStatus.css
* Root element in CSS file

## Why?
* Allows you to see full Discord avatars without the cropping
* Can help you crop your profile picture when selecting a new one
* Makes everything seem more organized
* Nostalgia

## Drawbacks 
* Some elements are square
* Drop shadows (easily removable in CSS file)

## Why did you make this
I personally do not enjoy the use of rounded avatars, they make me feel a constant stress that make me feel like I'm always missing part of an image. It also bothers me in the way that you cannot stack them without looking out of place.
